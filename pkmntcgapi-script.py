We're pinging the API after opening a 'session' which allows us to 
maintain a state of contact with the API.

From there, we draw on each page of 250 up to a total of 79 -
allPages - [for the moment (10/21)] and create logs of each of
them.  After that, we move on to the next until the end.  Admidst
all of that, we're checking for errors.
